I am a mathematician with a background in pure mathematics and numerical methods.
My work centres on function approximation, numerical integration, and the theory behind randomised algorithms.
<!Lately, I have been exploring how well-chosen point sets can outperform random sampling in high-dimensional problems, both in theory and through computational experiments.>

I am particularly interested in least-squares approximation, generated point sets and rank-1 lattices, and understanding the spectral properties of random matrices.
Most of my research combines theoretical analysis with computation.
I use a combination of Julia, C++ and Python for simulations.

If you would like to talk about mathematics, numerical methods, or possible collaborations, please feel free to get in touch!
